    "In applications where we need to sort entries with small integer keys and character strings from a discrete range, \n",
    "**Counting Sort** is often an excellent choice. Counting Sort is especially efficient for sorting integers within a small range \n",
    "because it operates in linear time, **O(n + k)**, where \\( n \\) is the number of elements to be sorted, and \\( k \\) is the range \n",
    "of input values (small in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Counting Sort?\n",
    "1. **Counting Sort is non-comparative**: Unlike typical comparison-based sorting algorithms (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort), \n",
    "   Counting Sort leverages the known range of keys to directly calculate positions, avoiding unnecessary comparisons.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Optimal for small integer ranges**: Since Counting Sort requires additional space proportional to the range \\( k \\), \n",
    "   it becomes very efficient for applications with small integer ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handles character strings well**: When sorting character strings, Counting Sort can be applied to each character \n",
    "   position, allowing for efficient sorting. This is often combined with **Radix Sort** for multi-character strings, \n",
    "   where each character position represents a digit in a multi-digit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Counting Sort\n",
    "Counting Sort is suitable when:\n",
    "- The keys are integers within a limited range.\n",
    "- We want a stable, linear-time sort.\n",
    "- The data set size is manageable with the extra space needed.\n",
